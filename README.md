# recursion

A small sandbox for experimenting with recursion

## recursionPractice.js

Exercises completed while following along with the curriculum.

## fibonacci.js

Solutions for printing the fibonacci sequence to the nth term, both iterative and recursive.

## mergeSort.js

A simple recursive solution for the mergeSort algorithm. This solution works quite well with smaller arrays, though it may not be appropriate for sorting larger data sets, as it makes use of the relatively inefficient `shift()` method.
